=========================
Lab 0: Environment Setup
=========================

*************
Introduction
*************
In Lab 0, you need to prepare the environment for future development.
You should install the target toolchain, and use them to build a bootable image for rpi3.

*****
Goals
*****

* Set up the development environment.
* Understand what's cross-platform development.
* Test your rpi3.

.. note::
  This lab is an introductory lab. 
  It won't be part of your final grade, but you still need to finish all ``required`` parts, 
  or you'll be in trouble in the next lab.

***************************
Cross-Platform Development
***************************

Cross Compiler
==============

Rpi3 uses ARM Cortex-A53 CPU.
To compile your source code to 64-bit ARM machine code, you need a cross compiler if you develop
on non-ARM64 environment.

``required`` Install a cross compiler on your host computer.

Linker
======

You might not notice the existence of linkers before.
It's because the compiler uses the default linker script for you. (``ld --verbose`` to check the content)
In bare metal programming, you should set the memory layout yourself.

This is an incomplete linker script for you. 
You should extend it in the following lab.

.. code-block:: none
  :linenos:

  SECTIONS
  {
    . = 0x80000;
    .text : { *(.text) }
  }
  

QEMU
====

In cross-platform development,
it's easier to validate your code on an emulator first.
You can use QEMU to test your code first before validating them on a real rpi3.

.. warning:: 
  Although QEMU provides a machine option for rpi3, it doesn't behave the same as a real rpi3.
  You should validate your code on your rpi3, too.

``required`` Install ``qemu-system-aarch64``.


********************************
From Source Code to Kernel Image
********************************

You have the basic knowledge of the toolchain for cross-platform development. Now, itâ€™s time to practice them.

From Source Code to Object Files
================================

Source code is converted to object files by cross compiler.
After saving the following assembly as ``a.S``, 
you can convert it to an object file by ``aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc -c a.S``

.. code-block:: c

  .section ".text"
  _start:
    wfe
    b _start

From Object Files to ELF
========================

A linker links object files to an ELF file.
An ELF file can be loaded and executed by program loaders.
Program loaders are usually provided by the operating system in regular development environment.
In bare metal programming, ELF can be loaded by some bootloaders.


To convert the object file from previous step to an ELF file,
you can save the provided linker script as ``linker.ld``, and run the following command.

.. code-block:: none

  aarch64-linux-gnu-ld -T linker.ld -o kernel8.elf a.o

From ELF to Kernel Image
========================

Rpi3's bootloader can't load ELF files.
Hence, you need to convert the ELF file to a raw binary image.
You can use ``objcopy`` to convert ELF files to raw binary.

.. code-block:: none

  aarch64-linux-gnu-objcopy -O binary kernel8.elf kernel8.img

Check on QEMU
=============

After building, you can use QEMU to see the dumped assembly.

.. code-block:: none

  qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi3 -kernel kernel8.img -display none -d in_asm

``required`` Build your first kernel image, and check it on QEMU.

*******************
Deploy to REAL Rpi3
*******************

Flash Bootable Image to SD Card
===============================

To prepare a bootable image for rpi3, you have to prepare at least the following stuff.

* An FAT16/32 partition contains

  * Firmware for GPU.

  * Kernel image.(kernel8.img)

There are two ways to do it.

1. 
  We already prepared a `bootable image
  <https://github.com/GrassLab/osdi/raw/master/supplement/nctuos.img>`_.
  You can use the following command to flash it to your SD card.

  .. code-block:: none

    dd if=nctuos.img of=/dev/sdb

  .. warning:: /dev/sdb should be replaced by your SD card device. You can check it by `lsblk`

  It's already partition and contains an FAT32 filesystem with firmware inside.
  You can mount the partition to check.

2. 
  Partition the disk and prepare the booting firmware yourself.
  You can download the firmware from 
  https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot

  bootcode.bin, fixup.dat and start.elf are essentials.
  More information about pi3's booting could be checked on official website
  https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/boot_folder.md
  https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/README.md

  Finally, put the firmware and your kernel image into the FAT partition.

  .. note::
    Besides using ``mkfs.fat -F 32`` to create an FAT32 filesystem, you should also set the partition type to FAT.


``required`` Use either one of the methods to set up your SD card.

Interact with Rpi3
==================

Use the provided `kernel8.img <https://github.com/GrassLab/osdi/raw/master/supplement/kernel8.img>`_ and connect TX, RX, GND to the corresponding pins on rpi3.
After power on, you can read and write data from /dev/ttyUSB0 (Linux).
You can use putty or screen with baud rate 115200 to interact with your rpi3.

.. code-block:: none

  screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

*********
Debugging
*********

Debug on QEMU
=============

Debugging on QEMU is a relatively easier way to validate your code.
QEMU could dump memory, registers, and expose them to a debugger.
You can use the following command waiting for gdb connection.

.. code-block:: none

  qemu-system-aarch64 -M raspi3 -kernel kernel8.img -display none -S -s

Then you can use the following command in gdb to load debugging information and connect to QEMU.

.. code-block:: none

  file kernel8.elf
  target remote :1234

.. note::
  Your gdb should also be cross-platform gdb.


Debug on Real Rpi3
==================

You could either use print log or JTAG to debug on a real rpi3.
We don't provide JTAG in this course, you can try it if you have one.
