NYCU, Operating System Capstone, Spring 2021
===========================================================

This course aims to introduce the design and implementation of the operating system kernel.
You'll learn both concept and implementation from a series of labs.

This course uses `Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ <https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/>`_ (rpi3 for short)
as a hardware platform.
Students can get their hands dirty on a **Real Machine** instead of an emulator.
